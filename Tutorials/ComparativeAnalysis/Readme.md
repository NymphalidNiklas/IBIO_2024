# Phylogenetic Comparative Methods

Here we will learn how to model the evolution of discrete and continuous characters over a phylogenetic tree. 

You can download the required input data files for this tutorial and the Felidae timed-tree we obtained as the result of [Tutorial 6](../TimingDivergence) from the folder [here](../../Data/Day4/ComparativeAnalysis)

Download all the input files (data files as well as the two tree files from the link above) and place them into a directory on your computer.

After downloading the data files, open your preferred environment (RStudio or other) for working with R and create a new R script/R Notebook/R Markdown file (whatever method you prefer).

You can now follow the tutorials below. It would be nice to create separate script/notebook files for the two separate tutorial below.

The tutorials are designed by following these two major sources - Phytools blog managed by Liam Revell (http://blog.phytools.org/) is a fantastic resource and the recent book: Revell & Harmon (2022). Phylogenetic Comparative Methods in R (https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691219035/phylogenetic-comparative-methods-in-r). 
For more on the theories behind how phylogenetic comparative methods work, Luke Harmon's free book is a great resource (https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/)
